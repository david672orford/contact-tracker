	<h2>About Contact Tracker</h2>
	<p>Use this application to keep track of your contact with other persons
	during the COVID-19 pandemic. All that is needed to record that you met
	someone is for one of you to scan the other's QR code. There is no need
	to give the other person your name or contact information.</p>
	<p>If it becomes necessary later, you can use this app to report a
	COVID-19 infection to anyone you met in person recently.
	The others will be informed that they were in contact with an infected
	person on a particular date, but they will not necessarily be able to
	guess that it was you. Still, this will be enough information for them	
	to talk to a doctor and decide whether they need to get a COVID-19 test
	or go into quarantine.</p>

	<h2>Authors</h2>
	<p>The Contact Tracker concept and theory of operation were devised by Mikhaylo
	Telychko. This implementation as a Progressive Web App (PWA) was written by David Chappell.
